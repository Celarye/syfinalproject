# Senior year final project
### This is a repository containing everything regarding my final project in my senior year of high school (6TW).

This repository will contain things like code for the website and Arduino/Raspberry Pi (still need to look into which one I will use), documentation of this project (in Dutch), spreadsheets of collected data and pictures of my practical test. For more info I recommend reading the documentation (the `FinalProject.docx` file).

## Currently working on

- Doing research regarding my practical test.

## To do

## The way this repository will work

- My full release (v1.0.0) is planned for in June 2023 but may come a bit earlier.

- Major releases (e.g. v0.2.0) will corresponded with certain phases of my project and will be on a monthly to bimonthly basis.

- Minor releases (e.g. v0.2.1) will be small changes and additions and will be on a weekly/daily basis.
