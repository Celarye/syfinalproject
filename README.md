## This is a repository containing everything regarding my final project in my senior year of high school

This repository will contain things like code for the website and sensors, documentation of this project (in Dutch), spreadsheets of collected data and pictures of my practical test. For more info I recommend reading the documentation (the `final-project.docx` file) or checking out the corresponding powerpoint (the `final-project.pptx` file).

## The way this repository works

- Minor releases (e.g. v0.2.1) will be small changes and additions and will be on a weekly basis.
- Major releases (e.g. v0.2.0) will corresponded with certain phases of my project and will be on a monthly to bimonthly basis.
- My full release (v1.0.0) is planned for the fourth of June 2023.
- Possible sequential releases may follow but aren't ensured.
